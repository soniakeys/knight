Knight
======
Knight's tour solution by ant colony optimization, following "Enumerating Knight's Tours using an Ant Colony Algorithm" by Philip Hingston and Graham Kendal.

Originally coded for Rosetta Code, but also previously posted at [Horse racing and ant colonies.](http://soniacodes.wordpress.com/2011/11/09/horse-racing-and-ant-colonies/)

The code is not generalized to solve other optimization problems, but kind of hard coded for the Knight's tour.  Still, it's fun to see it not just solve the Knight's tour, but find thousands of unique tours per second.
