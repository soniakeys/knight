= Knight

Knight's tour solution by ant colony optimization, following "Enumerating
Knight's Tours using an Ant Colony Algorithm" by Philip Hingston and Graham
Kendal.

Originally coded for Rosetta Code, but also previously posted on a blog which
is now offline.  I copied the post to this repo though, as blogpost.adoc.

The code is not generalized to solve other optimization problems, but kind of
hard coded for the Knight's tour.  Still, it's fun to see it not just solve
the Knight's tour, but find thousands of unique tours per second.
